S3 (Simple Storage Service)

---

## 🔹 Definition
- Amazon S3 is an **object-based storage service**.
- It provides **unlimited storage capacity**.
- Designed for **high durability, availability, scalability, and security**.
- Commonly used for **backup, archive, static website hosting, big data, and application data**.

---

## 🔹 Buckets
- Buckets are **logical containers** that store objects.
- Every object must belong to **one bucket**.
- **Bucket Naming Rules**:
  - Bucket names must be **globally unique** across all AWS accounts.
  - Must be **3–63 characters long**.
  - Only **lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (-)** allowed.
  - Cannot contain underscores or uppercase letters.
  - Cannot be IP-address formatted.
- Bucket is created in a **specific AWS region**.

---

## 🔹 Objects
- Objects are **actual files** stored in S3.
- Each object consists of:

### Object Components
- **Key**  
  - Unique name of the object within a bucket.
- **Value**  
  - Actual data (bytes of the file).
- **Version ID**  
  - Generated when versioning is enabled.
- **Metadata**  
  - Information about the object (content-type, size, last-modified).
- **Subresources**  
  - ACL (Access Control List)  
  - Torrent  

---

## 🔹 Data Consistency Model
- **Read-after-write consistency**  
  - For new object PUT operations (immediate access).
- **Eventual consistency**  
  - For overwrite PUTs and DELETE operations.
- Ensures **high performance at global scale**.

## 🔹 S3 Storage Classes (Strong & Detailed)

### 1️⃣ S3 Standard
- Designed for **frequently accessed data**.
- Low latency & high throughput.
- Stored across **multiple AZs**.
- Use cases:
  - Websites
  - Mobile & gaming apps
  - Content distribution
- Availability: **99.99%**
- Durability: **11 nines**

---

### 2️⃣ S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- Automatically moves data between access tiers.
- No performance impact.
- Reduces cost without manual intervention.
- Use cases:
  - Unknown or changing access patterns
- Small monitoring fee applies.

---

### 3️⃣ S3 Standard – Infrequent Access (IA)
- Lower storage cost than Standard.
- Data accessed less frequently but **needs rapid access**.
- Use cases:
  - Backups
  - Disaster recovery
- Retrieval fee applies.

---

### 4️⃣ S3 One Zone – IA
- Stores data in **single Availability Zone**.
- Lower cost than Standard-IA.
- No multi-AZ resilience.
- Use cases:
  - Secondary backups
  - Re-creatable data
- Not suitable for critical data.

---

### 5️⃣ S3 Glacier (Flexible Retrieval)
- Low-cost archival storage.
- Retrieval options:
  - Expedited (minutes)
  - Standard (3–5 hours)
  - Bulk (5–12 hours)
- Use cases:
  - Compliance
  - Archives
  - Long-term backups

---

### 6️⃣ S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- **Lowest-cost storage class**.
- Retrieval time: **~12 hours**.
- Designed for data accessed once or twice per year.
- Use cases:
  - Legal records
  - Financial archives
  - Long-term compliance data

---

## 🔹 Important Metrics & Limits
- **Durability**:  
  - 99.999999999% (11 9’s)
- **Availability**:
  - 99.99% (S3 Standard)
- **Bucket Limit**:
  - 100 buckets per AWS account (soft limit).
- **Max Object Size**:
  - 5 TB per object.
- **Multipart Upload**:
  - Required for objects > 5 GB.
  - Recommended for large files.

---

## 🔹 Additional S3 Features

### Versioning
- Maintains multiple versions of an object.
- Protects against accidental deletion or overwrite.
- Works well with lifecycle rules.

---

### Encryption
- **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**:
  - SSE-S3 (AWS-managed keys)
  - SSE-KMS (KMS-managed keys)
  - SSE-C (Customer-provided keys)
- **Client-Side Encryption**:
  - Encrypt data before uploading to S3.

---

### Replication
- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**:
  - Replicate data to another AWS region.
- **Same-Region Replication (SRR)**:
  - Replicate within same region.
- Requires versioning enabled.

---

### Lifecycle Management
- Automates transition between storage classes.
- Can delete objects after defined time.
- Reduces long-term storage cost.

---

### Transfer Acceleration
- Uses **CloudFront edge locations**.
- Speeds up uploads/downloads globally.
- Ideal for long-distance data transfers.

---

### Security & Access Control (Added)
- **Bucket Policies** (JSON-based).
- **IAM Policies**.
- **ACLs** (legacy).
- **Block Public Access** (recommended ON).
- Supports **VPC Endpoint access**.

---

### Static Website Hosting (Added)
- Host static HTML, CSS, JS websites.
- No server required.
- Integrated with CloudFront for CDN.
