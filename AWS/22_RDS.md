#  Shipping Custom NGINX Access Logs to CloudWatch using CloudWatch Agent  

---

## 🧠 Use Case
- Centralized log monitoring
- Real-time troubleshooting
- Security & access auditing
- Production-grade observability

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

NGINX (access.log) ↓ CloudWatch Agent ↓ CloudWatch Log Group ↓ Log Streams (per EC2 instance)

---

## 🔐 Step 1: Prerequisites & IAM Role

CloudWatch Agent requires permissions to push logs.

### 1.1 Create / Select IAM Role
- Go to **IAM → Roles**
- Create or select an existing role
- Trusted entity: **AWS Service**
- Use case: **EC2**
- Attach policy:
  - `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy` ✅
- Save role

### 1.2 Attach IAM Role to EC2
- Go to **EC2 Dashboard**
- Select EC2 instance
- Actions → Security → **Modify IAM role**
- Select the role
- Click **Update IAM role**

✅ EC2 can now send logs to CloudWatch

---

## 🖥️ Step 2: Connect to EC2 & Install CloudWatch Agent

### 2.1 Connect to EC2 (Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo -i
```
2.2 Update System & Install Dependencies
```bash
apt update -y
apt install -y curl unzip
```
2.3 Download CloudWatch Agent
```bash
curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/ubuntu/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
```
2.4 Install CloudWatch Agent
```bash
dpkg -i -E ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
```

---

🌐 Step 3: Install NGINX (Critical Step)

⚠️ Important:
NGINX log files do not exist until NGINX is installed and running.

3.1 Install NGINX
```bash
apt install -y nginx
```
3.2 Verify Log Files
```bash
cd /var/log/nginx/
ls
```
Expected output:

access.log
error.log


---

⚙️ Step 4: Configure CloudWatch Agent for Logs

4.1 Create / Edit Configuration File
```bash
vim cwagent-config.json

4.2 Paste Log Configuration JSON

{
  "agent": {
    "metrics_collection_interval": 60,
    "logfile": "/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log"
  },
  "logs": {
    "logs_collected": {
      "files": {
        "collect_list": [
          {
            "file_path": "/var/log/nginx/access.log",
            "log_group_name": "nginx-access-log-group",
            "log_stream_name": "{instance_id}"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Save and exit:

Esc → :wq → Enter


---

▶️ Step 5: Start Agent & Load Configuration

5.1 Start CloudWatch Agent
```bash
/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
-a fetch-config \
-m ec2 \
-c file:./cwagent-config.json \
-s
```
5.2 Verify Agent Status
```bash
/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
-m ec2 \
-a status
```
Expected:

status: running


---

🔎 Step 6: Generate Traffic & Verify Logs

6.1 Generate NGINX Access Logs

Copy EC2 Public IP

Paste into browser:

http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>

Refresh page multiple times


6.2 Verify in CloudWatch

Go to CloudWatch → Logs → Log groups

Open:

nginx-access-log-group

Select log stream (Instance ID)

You should see NGINX access logs streaming live



---

🧹 Step 7: Cleanup (Optional)

7.1 Stop CloudWatch Agent
```bash
/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
-m ec2 \
-a stop
```
7.2 Delete Resources

CloudWatch → Logs → Delete nginx-access-log-group

EC2 Dashboard → Terminate instance

(Optional) Delete IAM Role



---

✅ Key Takeaways

NGINX must be installed before log shipping

CloudWatch Agent supports custom log files

IAM Role is mandatory (no access keys)

Log Streams are created per EC2 instance

Production-ready logging setup
